Chef-cookbooks
==============

This is my collection of chef cookbooks, which have been proved to work good in real projects. Creating a standalone cookbook repository (separate from the project repositories) should help creating new chef-based projects quickly and easily.

Details
-------

Collection is split into two directories:
* recipes/cookbooks contains standard cookbooks that have been imported from 3rd parties, mostly from [chef community cookbooks](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks);
* site/cookbooks contains custom cookbooks that I created for various occasions.

This repository also includes a very basic Vagrantfile, which just creates a minimal box with no additional software installed.
